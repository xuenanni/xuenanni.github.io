	<p>I am a graduate student at DUSP. I am pursuing master degrees of city planning and science in transportation. I expect to graduate in June, 2019. My interests are urban transportation, TOD and global mobility. I am passionate about using data to tell appealing stories about our cities. My skill set: I am familiar with R to crunch the data, ArcGIS and QGIS to perform spatial analysis and SQL to manage database. I am also learning using python and JavaScript to create interactive mapping at school now. I come from Jinan, China. I like jogging, boxing and learning to play tennis.</p>

    <p>This map showing food deserts in Baltimore is created by JHU, together with Baltimore Food Policy Initiative. Food deserts in general means areas where income level is low and residents do not have easy access (within walking distance in urban areas or a reasonable driving distance in rural areas) to high-quality, healthy food (typically in the form of a supermarket). Food deserts are measured according to 4 critetia: the distance to a supermarket is more than 1/4 mile, the median household income is at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level, over 40% of households have no vehicle available, and the average Healthy Food Availability Index score for supermarkets, conenience and corner stores is low (measured using the Nutrition Environment Measurement Survey and in this project, scores lower than 8.7 is considered poor). This project collected spatial data of Baltimore City and used GIS to select population groups that locate more than 1/4 mile away from supermarkets, have househood income level below 185% of federal poverty level, greater than 40% do not have vehicles and are scored lower than 8.7. The result regarding where food deserst are located is shown in the map. By using GIS, we can clearly identify places where people do not have easy access to healthy food. The map may help policy makers have more comprohensive view on urban food problems, understand the spatial pattern of social inequality, and finally target on places where needs are most urgent.</p>
